ðŸ”µ **Data Shadowing**      
If method's local variable and class level variable having same name then inside the method local priority will goes to method's local variable. That is known as data shadowing.In this case 'this' Keyword is use to access class level variable. 

ðŸ”µ **Data Hiding**     
In case of Inheritance if parent class data member and child class data memeber having same name then from child class priority will goes to child class data member, that is known as data hiding.  In this case 'super' keyword is use to access parent class variable.
